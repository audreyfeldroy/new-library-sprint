# Planning Your New Library

These instructions are for sprinters who want to create an open-source Python library.

## Why?

A great way to contribute to Python is by taking code that you normally copy-paste over and over and packaging it up for the Python Package Index.

## Overview

Here's what you'll do:

1. Think carefully about your Python code snippets
2. Come up with a name for a reusable library

## Steps

1. Choose a name for your library. Look at PyPI for examples. This will be your project's name.
2. If the name contains spaces, turn them into underscores. Use lowercase rather than CamelCase.
