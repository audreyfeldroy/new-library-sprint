# Planning Your New Library

These instructions are for sprinters who want to create an open-source Python library.

## Why?

A great way to contribute to Python is by taking code that you normally copy-paste over and over and packaging it up for the Python Package Index.

## Overview

Here's what you'll do:

1. Think carefully about your Python code snippets
2. Come up with a name for a reusable library

## Steps

1. TODO
2. TODO

## Summary

You have now released your library:

* On GitHub as an open-source project
* On PyPI as an open-source Python package

Now others can use your library in their projects. They can even contribute back with bug fixes and new features.
