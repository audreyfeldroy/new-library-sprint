# Choosing Code!

The hardest part of creating a new Python library is coming up with a good idea.

## Suggestions for your first Python library

### Pick something useful

Try to pick something useful that you've written or want to write:

* A useful function
* A few functions that are related somehow
* A class that does something useful
* A useful context manager
* Any other useful snippet

#### How do you know if it's useful?

Here are some signs that a piece of code is useful:

* You've copied and pasted it from one project to another
* You could imagine use cases for wanting it in future projects

### Don't be overambitious

For this sprint, keep your scope as small as possible. If this is your first Python package, the less lines of code, the better.

Even a useful 3-line function is worth packaging.

See [cached-property: Don't copy-paste code](http://pydanny.com/cached-property.html) for a story about a time that Daniel Greenfeld turned a tiny snippet that seemed unworthy of packaging into a useful package.

## Still stuck?

If you have no idea what to work on, consider:

* Simple string utility functions
* A web scraping function
* A function that analyzes some "Big Data"
* A simple command line tool for doing something with files
* A cool image processing function

### Don't panic

Remember, **don't panic**.

Your first Python library doesn't have to be one that changes the world.

For your first effort, it's even okay if your library is a bit silly. No one is probably even going to notice your library among the 45,000+ PyPI packages.
