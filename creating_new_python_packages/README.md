# Creating a skeleton Python package

Every Python package contains certain files.

## Overview

You will generate the skeleton for a bare-bones Python package with Cookiecutter and cookiecutter-pypackage.

Here's what you'll do:

1. Take 1 or more Python code snippets and turn them into a reusable library
2. Put it on GitHub
3. Register/upload it to the Python Package Index

## Steps

1. Run Cookiecutter with cookiecutter-pypackage:

    ```
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git
    ```

2. Answer the prompts:

    ```
    TODO show example of prompts
    ```

3. Examine the directory that was generated.

    ```
    ls
    cd repo_name
    ls
    ```
